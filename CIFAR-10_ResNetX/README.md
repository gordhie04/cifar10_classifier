The model demonstrates strong performance across all 10 CIFAR-10 classes, with particularly high accuracy on vehicle categories.

## Architecture

Custom ResNet-50 architecture adapted for CIFAR-10's 32×32 images:

- Initial convolution (3→64 channels)
- Layer 0: 3 Residual Blocks (64 channels)
- Layer 1: 4 Residual Blocks (128 channels, stride=2)
- Layer 2: 6 Residual Blocks (256 channels, stride=2)
- Layer 3: 3 Residual Blocks (512 channels, stride=2)
- Adaptive Global Average Pooling
- Fully Connected (512→10 classes)

**Key Features:**
- Residual blocks with skip connections
- Batch normalization after each convolution
- No MaxPooling layer (preserves spatial information)
